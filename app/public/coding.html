                <span class="first-character sc">I</span>started learning HTML, CSS, and WordPress about six years ago while I was working as a graphic designer
                on the college newspaper. Although this didn’t take much technical knowledge, it did help me get familiar
                with the fundimentals of HTML and CSS. Then after graduation I used WebsiteBuilder to design the website for a company
                I was helping to start. Although this company didn’t go as far as would’ve liked, I realized that building
                websites is what I really excelled at and enjoyed doing. 
                <br><br>
                In addition to the six years of WordPress experience, I really began to get serious about learning to code 
                in the later part of 2016. I started learning by taking classes on Lynda and Udemy to prepare as much as I could for the 
                program at Northwestern University. During my time there we learned everything from HTML to MySQL to React. 
                There were weekly homeworks that focused on gleaning a specific skill except for the weeks we were working on projects.  
                <br><br>
                The first project that I worked on was an application that would suggest a plan for a date night. A user just needed to put in
                their zip code and Google's geocoder would autofill the city and state. Then we asked the user for the cuisine type they wanted 
                to eat along with a genre of movie. We used the New York Times API to return a move based on their answer for the type of movie they wanted to watch. 
                Then to randomly generate what restaurant we were suggesting based on their zip code and desired food we used the Google Maps API as well as Firebase.(Above: API Integration)  
                <br><br>
                My second project was a website that was inspired by the big Colorado state seal debacle in 2014. People were outraged by the lack of foresight that the 
                state used to make a new logo. After just watching a TED talk about "Why City Flags May be the Worst-Designed Things You've Never Noticed" I thought it would be an interesting project. 
                We focused on artists, and when they create possible new flag they upload it to our site, then people within a given city can up vote it or down vote it, similar to Stack Overflow. We used Node, Express, SQL, 
                Cloudinary, and Sequalize to get it up and running.(Above: Node/Express/SQL)
                <br>
                <br>

                Through the full stack web development program, and taking classes my own, I have become a compentent developer in the following areas:
                <ul>
                    <li>HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, JQuery, Node, Handlebars, MySQL, Mongo, and React.</li>
                    <li>Responsive web design elements and GitHub/version control.</li>
                    <li>Using JSON and AJAX for data transfers and API integration.</li>
                    <li>Incorporating NPM Packages to build full-stack applications.</li>
                    <li>Creating, adding, removing, and maintaining data in Firebase, SQL, and NoSQL.</li>
